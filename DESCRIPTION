Title: Generate Plausible but Fake Data for Better Looking Results
Version: 2.0.15
Author: Amelie Baak, Kilian Senger

Description: A comedic R package inspired by the "volkswagen" npm package from https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen
    This package automatically generates plausible-looking but completely fake data
    to make your statistical analyses look better than they actually are.
    Perfect for when your real data doesn't support your hypothesis but you
    need impressive results anyway. Use responsibly (or not at all).
    This package is really just a joke and should not be used for anything.
