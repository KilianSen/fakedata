\title{Generate Fake Effect Sizes}
\usage{
fake_effect_size(effect_sizes, target_size = 0.8, method = "multiply")
}
\arguments{
\item{effect_sizes}{Vector of actual effect sizes that are probably tiny}

\item{target_size}{Minimum desired effect size (default 0.8 for "large" effect)}

\item{method}{Method for enhancing effect sizes: "multiply" (multiply by random factor),
"replace" (replace with impressive values), or "cohen" (use Cohen's benchmarks)}
}
\value{
Vector of "enhanced" effect sizes that now look practically significant
}
\description{
This function takes your pathetically small effect sizes and makes them impressive!
Perfect for when your Cohen's d is embarrassingly small but you need to show "practical significance."
}
\examples{
# Your disappointing real effect sizes
real_effects <- c(0.05, 0.12, 0.08, 0.03, 0.15)

# Make them impressive!
fake_effects <- fake_effect_size(real_effects, method = "cohen")
print(fake_effects)

# Or use multiplication for more "realistic" enhancement
fake_effects2 <- fake_effect_size(real_effects, method = "multiply")
print(fake_effects2)
}
